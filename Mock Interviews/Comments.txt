Question: Write a function that returns True or False if strings s1, s2 are anagrams of each other?

PROS:
Asked clarifying questions about the problem
Ran through a couple of examples
Thought of the right Data Structure (hash map) to solve the problem

CONS:
Didn’t run through edge case examples when clarifying
Should discuss approach before starting to code
Need to be careful of typos when typing during an interview, on a whiteboard it’s easier to let slide, on a keyboard, usually more scrutinized 
Used the wrong data structure / mis-implemented at first
Said didn’t remember full implementation
